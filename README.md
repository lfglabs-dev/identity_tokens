## What is an identity token?
An identity token is a token held by a starknet identity, not a wallet. This makes a lot of sense for some applications: for instance a diploma should not be issued to a wallet that can change owner but to a person. It also brings new features that are not possible with current wallets like the ability to equip a token.
